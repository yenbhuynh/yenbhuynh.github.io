```{r}
library(reticulate)
mtcars
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars,aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point(aes(color=hp)) + scale_color_gradient(low = "red", high = "green" )
```

```{python}
import numpy as np
print("The average miles/gallon of the cars is " + str(np.mean(r.mtcars["mpg"])) + "\n")
```

```{python}
print("The average weight of the cars is \n" + str(np.mean(r.mtcars["wt"])) + "\n")
```

```{python}
print("The average gross horsepower of the trees is " + str(np.mean(r.mtcars["hp"])) + "\n")
