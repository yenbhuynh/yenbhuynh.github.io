#HERE IS MY PROJECT The dataset was acquired from the Exposome Explorer website (http://exposome-explorer.iarc.fr/). This website a database about biomarkers of exposure to environmental risk factors for diseases. From this site, I got a cancer associations dataset. This datatset is about the different acquired specimens of cancer patients. The dataset, generally, provides information such as what biomarkers were used to identify the different cancers, what kind of analytical method (GC-MS, LC-MS, HPLC, etc) were used, and some other related epidemiological data.</description>
